Financial Institution Project

A Data-Driven Visualization & Analysis System Using SQL, Python, and Tableau

📌 Overview

This project transforms traditional passbook-based financial records into a digital, interactive analytics system.
Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, I designed a set of dashboards that reveal customer behavior, savings trends, loan patterns, and transaction insights for a small financial institution.

Note: All data displayed in this public repository is synthetic (fake) and generated solely for demonstration purposes.
No real customer information is shared.
All SQL and Python source tables used in the real project are kept private.

📊 Project Components
1. SQL Database Design (Private)

Created structured SQL tables for customers, savings, loans, and transactions.

Cleaned and transformed raw records from physical passbooks.

Performed aggregation, filtering, joins, and derived calculations.

SQL code is stored in a private repository for confidentiality.

2. Python Data Cleaning (Private)

Handled missing values, data-type fixes, and validation checks.

Ensured datasets were fully ready for Tableau ingestion.

Python scripts remain private.

3. Tableau Dashboards (Public Visuals Only)

This repository includes screenshots of the Tableau dashboards I created:

Customer Dashboard (demographics, regional map, balance vs loan trend)

Loans Dashboard (loan type insights, interest rate analysis, loan closure timelines)

Savings Dashboard (saving-type trends, fixed deposit dominance, top balance contributors)

Transactions Dashboard (payment methods, revenue by type, heatmaps, customer activity trends)

Only dashboard images are public.
Underlying Tableau workbook & data extracts are not shared.

✨ Key Insights from the Visualizations
Customer Behavior

Middle-aged customers (36–50) are the largest segment.

Eastern & central Nepal show highest customer density.

Outstanding loans exceed current balances → credit-heavy customer base.

Loan Patterns

Education loans are most common with lowest interest.

Auto loans are least common but highest interest.

Seasonal spikes in loan issuance (March, Oct–Nov).

Loans generally close near due dates → strong repayment behavior.

Saving Trends

Fixed Deposits dominate the savings portfolio.

Monthly savings have grown significantly in recent years.

Strong customer retention reflected in repeated high balances.

Transaction Insights

Cash and card payments drive most revenue.

Cheque usage is minimal.

Loan payments represent the largest transaction amounts.

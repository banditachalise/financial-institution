## 🔑 Key Insights from Dashboards

### Customer Dashboard
- Middle-aged customers (36–50) dominate.  
- Central and eastern regions have highest density.  
- Outstanding loans exceed current balances → credit-heavy customer base.

### Loan Dashboard
- Education loans are most frequent with lowest interest.  
- Auto loans are least frequent but highest interest.  
- Seasonal spikes in loan issuance (March, Oct–Nov).  
- Loans generally close near due dates → strong repayment behavior.

### Savings Dashboard
- Fixed Deposits dominate; Monthly Savings are growing.  
- Top balances span multiple years → strong retention and loyalty.

### Transaction Dashboard
- Cash and card payments drive most revenue.  
- Loan payments contribute the largest transaction amounts.  
- Cheque usage is minimal.
